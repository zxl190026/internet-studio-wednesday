      <h2>Summary of the Six Thinking Hats</h2>

  <article class="hat-block" id="white-hat">
    <h3>White Hat Thinking</h3>
      <p>In white hat thinking, the discussion revolves around objective facts and data. Participants gather existing information and clearly identify any missing data. They ask clarifying questions, such as "What information do we currently have?", "What specific data do we need to make a decision?", and "How can we obtain this information?" The conversation emphasizes neutrality and rationality, avoiding emotion or speculation. The goal is to establish a clear "information map" that allows everyone to build on the same data for further thinking.</p>

  <article class="hat-block" id="red-hat">
    <h3>Red Hat Thinking</h3>
      <p>In red hat thinking, the discussion shifts to emotions, intuition, and instinctive reactions. Participants are free to express their feelings, such as "I'm a little uneasy about this plan" or "I have a gut feeling that this will lead to good results." These opinions don't require logic or evidence, as the focus is on allowing emotions and intuition to be present in the discussion, rather than hiding them behind so-called "rationality." This stage helps the team understand the emotional resonance or resistance a proposal might evoke, allowing them to more comprehensively consider the decision's acceptability. </p>

  <article class="hat-block" id="black-hat">
    <h3>Black Hat Thinking</h3>
      <p>In Black Hat Thinking, the discussion focuses on criticism and caution. Participants logically point out potential problems and risks, such as "not in line with current policy," "difficult to implement," or "potential serious side effects." The value of this step lies in reminding the team to consider worst-case scenarios and avoid blind optimism. Black Hat critiques must be based on logic and facts, not personal bias. They emphasize caution and rational criticism, making them crucial for ensuring that proposals withstand the test of reality. </p>

  <article class="hat-block" id="yellow-hat">
    <h3>Yellow Hat Thinking</h3>
      <p>Yellow Hat Thinking shifts to a positive and constructive perspective. Discussants look for potential benefits and potential, such as "This approach could reduce costs," "It would increase customer satisfaction," or "This initiative could create long-term value." Even in the face of criticism, Yellow Hat Thinking emphasizes finding ways to improve and opportunities. This phase focuses the team on promise, feasibility, and benefits, injecting momentum and enthusiasm into the solution. </p>

  <article class="hat-block" id="green-hat">
    <h3>Green Hat Thinking</h3>
      <p>The Green Hat Thinking phase is a stage for creative and divergent thinking. Participants may propose new ideas or alternatives, such as "What if we tried a different approach?" or "Is there a more innovative combination?" This discussion is often exploratory and groundbreaking, and even ideas that sound immature are encouraged. Green Hat Thinking helps teams break free from inertia and limitations, offering diverse solutions and often responding to concerns raised by Black Hat thinkers. </p>

  <article class="hat-block" id="blue-hat">
    <h3>Blue Hat Thinking</h3>
      <p>Blue Hat Thinking takes on an organizing and coordinating role, similar to a meeting moderator. During this phase, participants review the entire discussion to ensure their thinking is organized and focused. Blue Hat thinkers decide which hat to apply next, such as "We need more data, so let's go back to White Hat Thinking" or "After listening to criticism, let's do another Green Hat divergence." They also summarize the findings from each phase and formulate clear conclusions or action steps. Blue Hat Thinking helps discussions maintain direction and efficiency, ensuring that the contributions of each hat ultimately converge into actionable solutions. </p>

<h2>My Primary Thinking Style: Red Hat First</h2>
      <img src="img/Red_Hat.png" alt="redhat" class="hat-img" />
      <p>I tend to lean towards Red Hat Thinking because I'm an INFP, which makes me more comfortable relying on emotion and intuition when thinking about problems. I often prioritize my own and others' feelings, rather than relying solely on data or logic. In discussions, I tend to intuitively express my likes and dislikes about a matter or the atmosphere, and these feelings can sometimes guide my decisions more effectively than rational analysis. While this approach can appear emotional, it allows me to quickly grasp the underlying atmosphere, the emotional dynamics between people, and the direction my intuition suggests. Therefore, Red Hat Thinking aligns well with my personality traits, giving me legitimacy to express my emotions while also helping me bring a more human and intuitive perspective to team discussions.</p>
