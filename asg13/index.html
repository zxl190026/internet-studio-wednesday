      <h1>My Dream Jobs</h1>
      <p class="intro"> My ideal job revolves around <strong>post-production/video editing/sound design</strong>. I am proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro/After Effects, DaVinci Resolve (basic color grading), and Logic Pro/Ableton for music production and arrangement. I hope to join a team that values narrative and sonic expression, continuously refining the entire workflow from rough cut to fine cut, from score to mixing.</p>

          <p class="job-desc"> I enjoy streamlined processes and tasks that "make projects run more smoothly and faster." This role involves organizing materials, conforming proxies and final cuts, cleaning the timeline, and preparing for handover to the color grading and mixing departments. These tasks hone my sensitivity to technical details while maintaining creative efficiency and consistency. I also occasionally write simple scripts/quick templates for batch processing to improve team collaboration speed.</p>
