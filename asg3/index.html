<h2>Do's and Don'ts of Web Design</h2>
	<p>Here's an example of a violation of Rule 6: <a href="https://contrastrebellion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://contrastrebellion.com/</a></p>

<h2>Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles</h2>
	<p>Framing a project in a story format helps refine ideas because it forces you to think about the experience as a journey rather than a collection of isolated features. By defining characters, their motivations, the challenges they face, and the resolution your design provides, you create a coherent narrative that reveals gaps or contradictions in your concept. This approach makes abstract goals concrete, clarifies the emotional impact of your solution, and ensures that every design decision contributes to moving the “story” forward. In practice, it not only sharpens your own thinking but also makes it easier to communicate the value of your project to others, since people naturally understand and connect with stories.</p>
