	<h2>Why I Like Them</h2>
	<p>I love Twenty One Pilots because their songs seamlessly blend melody and emotional expression, boasting sing-along hooks while directly addressing themes like anxiety, loneliness, and self-reconciliation. Whether it's the layered arrangements in their studio recordings or the drumming and interplay in their live performances, they resonate and energize me across a range of emotions.</p>
