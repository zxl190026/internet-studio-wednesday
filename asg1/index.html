   <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
   <h2>Three things I learned from reading material</h2>
   <p>The article "Evolution of the Web" inspired me to think about the future of the internet: web technologies continue to advance how humans access, interact, and collaborate. It reminds us that the next phase of the internet's development isn't just about technological evolution; it's also about who owns data, who benefits from it, and what kind of digital society we want to build.</p>
  
   <p>The article "The Wax and the Wane of the Web" notes that web technologies and design thinking are constantly in a cycle of emergence, retreat, and reemergence. This process reminds me that even if we think we have sufficient skills today, the web is always evolving. Only by continuously learning and embracing change can we stay at the forefront.</p>
  
   <p>My memories of the "freedom" and "messiness" brought by technology remind me of the power of standardization. The article mentions that in the early days, developers were constantly navigating chaos; the establishment of a system of "web standards" not only standardized the development process but also improved engineering efficiency and cross-device compatibility. This shift made me realize that as developers, we must not only pursue innovation but also respect the inherent characteristics of the platform and the diversity of users, building web experiences in a more inclusive and robust way.</p>



<h2>My Semester Project</h2>
   <p>For my semester project, I plan to design and develop an e-commerce website for selling clothes. The platform will provide a clean and intuitive interface that allows customers to easily explore a wide range of clothing categories, view detailed product descriptions, and filter items based on size, style, or price. Users will be able to add selected products to their shopping cart and proceed through a streamlined checkout process that ensures convenience and security.</p>
