      <p>We all agreed that a fashion brand domain name needs to be short, concise, and consistent with the brand's tone. During the discussion, our classmates suggested prioritizing short domain names that could be used for labels/hangtags, and evaluating their suitability for future line expansion. We also confirmed the availability of domain names and Instagram/TikTok usernames to maintain brand consistency.</p>

      <h2>The domain name I like best and why</h2>
      <p>fashionicet.com is my favorite. It's short, easy to read and write, and includes the brand name, Ice T, making it suitable for advertising slogans and visuals. It also leaves room for expansion into new styles- ready-to-wear, accessories, and collaborations.</p>
