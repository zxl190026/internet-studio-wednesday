<h1>My least favorite musician: Selena Gomez</h1> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selena_Gomez" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Why don't I like her music? </h2>
<div>
<p><span>Preference Note:</span> For me, some of her albums feel a bit flat in terms of vocals and arrangements, lacking the melodic hooks and tonal depth that keep me coming back for more. Also, the production of many singles focuses more on electronic textures and rhythmic buildup than on emotional expression or instrumental detail, which doesn't align with my musical tastes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Three artists I prefer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Billie Eilish</li>
<li>Halsey</li>
<li>Lana Del Rey</li>
</ul>
